### Social Media: Boon or Bane?

Social Media is a Good Thing or a Bad Thing

Social media is a good thing or bad in the recent debate or news nowadays.

But everything has two sides and two impacts good as well as bad. 

It depends on every individual how he perceives it or takes it.

it may have a negative impact on the person who has a bad experience through social and

On the good or positive impact on someone who had never had any bad experience there. We have some negative as well as positive impacts that are been mentioned and as follows-

Positive Impact-

It had been an easy and convenient method to connect with your friends easily around the world

Also, you can chat with the people whom you know as your relatives and who are abroad. The most important thing is that you don't need to travel anywhere to send your messages to people. It is through social media you can do it easily and build relationships with the people and friends whom you had lost contact with.

It is through social media you can raise your voice, connect and target the audience know what you want to convey. The sharing feature is available through which you can just click on share and remove your privacy and then click share. It would be shared with the large number of people who are not even on your friends' list. Also, you can be able to communicate your thoughts and perception freely.

A large number of people who is in the business industry have profited because they can advertise and do their marketing on social media without even paying its just that they create their pages and marketize and they won't have to pay a single penny plus they don't have to look out a person to advertise and publicize or do marketing if they are well aware and know how to use social media then they can also get profit out of it.

Negative impacts-

It leads to addiction among the youngster and adults and they spend a lot of time being active on social media platforms. They spend their time chatting and seeing the post of others and clicking on liking and going through the profiles to make friends on it. They keep on posting their content as well like pictures videos and to get followers and attention on their profile

It leads to isolation the youngsters don't like to spend time with their families instead they devote their all-time being on social media. It has been seen that they sometimes express their problems on social media rather than discussing them with their families. Their friends in turn post suggestions which sometimes incorrect because they don't know what the actual problem is and the person who posted the problem takes the suggestion without even thinking which might lead them to depression, anxiety, and isolation disorders

It leads to less productivity because now during the covid time employees spent large time on their social media and less time on work which hamper their productivity and less working hours during their shift timings. Also, a client who is working with big companies does not send messages at times sometimes because the work is hampered due to the employees which waste a lot of time on social media and it affects the business in some way or the other. This leads to less turnover and the company name has also deteriorated like people don't want to be a part of these kinds of firms where the work is not going on smoothly

Conclusion

Social media has good as well as bad impacts on should not overuse it to get on danger and our opinion stands somewhere in between that it is good as well but one should not know how much to use it and how much time they should spend so that it does not harm them in many ways.

#### **What is a Social networking site:**
- Social networking sites (SNS) are online platforms where people can meet other people and can make friendships. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are a few examples of SNS.
- Social networking was started on the internet in the form of generalized online communities to group people having the same interests and to share their ideas.
- The first recognizable social networking site is SixDegrees.com which was launched in 1997.
- Now, there are lots of social networking sites for specific interests.

#### **Social networking sites – Boon:**
- We can keep in touch with friends in today’s busy world. Moreover, we can find our friends easily, even if we lost contact.
- We can share our ideas, information and knowledge with those, who have the same interests, even if they are so many miles away from us.
- Many companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals to share business needs & experiences.
- Students are connecting with employers via LinkedIn kind of SNS for job opportunities and internships.
- Generally, social networking sites create a positive atmosphere. For example, many social networking sites don’t send notifications, if someone is removed as a friend.

#### **Social networking sites – Bane:**
- People are increasingly comparing their lives with others who are projecting their life as perfect. This decreases happiness levels and also can lead to self-esteem issues for many people, especially teenagers.
- Privacy is a big drawback of SNS. Cybercriminals use the personal information of others for malicious intentions.
- [Addiction](https://www.groupdiscussionideas.com/impact-social-media-youth/) is another big drawback of SNS. Many people are spending several hours per day on social networking sites such as Instagram, Twitter etc. Spending in front of the computer for long hours creates many health problems.
- A lot of SNS users are preferring online conversations rather than face-to-face conversations. It is affecting their real-life communication skills, relationships and even mental health.
- Children and teenagers are [vulnerable to cybercrimes](https://www.groupdiscussionideas.com/can-deal-increasing-cyber-crimes/).
- Gossips and rumours can become viral in an instant, which can cause trauma for the people involved.

#### **Conclusion:**
Social networking sites are a boon. But children and teenagers must be guided by their guardians because they are vulnerable to cybercrimes. When we use the sites for the advantages they provide without disclosing too much personal information, we can utilize the sites without becoming a victim to them. However, life will be great if we spend less time on social networking sites and more time in the real world.
